== Use Gradle to set up a BCD-UI project

=== Overview

This section it about building a simple BCD-UI project with link:https://gradle.org/[gradle, window="_blank"].
All libraries required are
specified as dependencies and it is therefore easy to get the application setup.

The following steps are necessary in general:

. Add gradle.build to the project
. Configure gradle support for the project
. Refresh dependencies

=== Step by Step

==== Gradle plugin

IDEA and eclipse come with gradle already. When using VC Code, install gradle and use it from command line.

==== Add Gradle.build to the project

Create a build.gradle file in the root directory of your project.

[source,groovy]
----

apply plugin: "java"
apply plugin: "war"


webAppDirName = "WebContent"

war {
  baseName   = "GettingStarted"
  includeEmptyDirs = false
}
dependencies {
  repositories {
    mavenCentral()
    maven {
      url "https://github.com/businesscode/maven-repo/raw/master"
    }
    implementation 'de.businesscode.bcdui:bcd-ui-core:5.5.0-SNAPSHOT'
    implementation 'de.businesscode.bcdui:bcd-ui-theme-bcd:5.5.0-SNAPSHOT'
  }
}
----

==== Configure Gradle support for the project

Before we can use the gradle file within eclipse, we have to add the "Gradle Nature" to the GettingStarted project. So select the project,
open the context menu and choose menu:Configure[Add Gradle Nature].


==== Refresh dependencies

Afterwards the context menu has a new entry for gradle. Use it to refresh the project.
This might take some time, because all libraries specified
by the dependencies above will be loaded.

After gradle refresh, the project has its dependencies, and these can be found in the project tree as shown in the following image.
