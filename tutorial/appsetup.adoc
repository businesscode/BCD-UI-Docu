== Application Setup

A BCD-UI application is a regular Jakarta EE application. These steps are show how to add BCD-UI to an existing web application project.

There are many good tutorials for each IDE on how to set up such a web application. For Eclipse you could follow https://medium.com/@zandra.harner/setting-up-the-develop-environment-for-lop-a-web-application-in-eclipse-ide-7f3a36eddf60[this] one on Medium.

[IMPORTANT]
Before adding BCD-UI to your project, make sure you test your plain web application. Open a page, call a test Servlet, all without BCD-UI. You should be familiar with running a web application without BCD-UI as it's the bases for BCD-UI.

=== Adding BCD-UI

. Add BCD-UI jars +
See https://github.com/businesscode/maven-repo for maven and gradle.
Add a `build.gradle` file as shown there to your project root.
+
When working with Eclipse, open menu:File[Import...|Existing Gradle Project] and select your project root. It worked when you see BCD and all of its dependencies under `Project and External Dependencies`.
+

+
TIP: These two jars not only hold all Java classes for the server but also all client side sources of BCD-UI like JavaScript and XSLT. BCD-UI has a Servlet that makes sure they are served to the client along with your client side sources, which are placed were you would usually place them.
+
If you prefer to go without maven, you may also download the BCD-UI's jars, and their dependencies mentioned in https://github.com/businesscode/BCD-UI/blob/master/Docu/development/bcdui_dependencies.gradle[BCD-UI/Docu/development/bcdui_dependencies.gradle] and put them into WEB-INF/lib manually.
+

. Add Entries to web.xml +
To register BCD-UI's servlets and filters, add the entries from link:https://github.com/businesscode/BCD-UI/blob/master/Server/configFiles/web.xml[BCD-UI/Server/configFiles/web.xml, window="_blank"] to your web.xml. +
Now comment out the <filter> bcdui4.ShiroFilter including its <filter-mapping>. Otherwise, you will be redirected to a login.htm page, which you do not have yet. +
When you upgrade to a new version of BCD-UI check in https://github.com/businesscode/BCD-UI/blob/master/Docu/releaseNotes.adoc[release notes] whether it changed.

. Create an empty WEB-INF/bcdui/bindings +
All configuration files for BCD-UI are located at WEB-INF/bcdui. Create an empty `WEB-INF/bcdui/bindings` folder, later you'll add <<DocBinding,Bindings>> here.

. Add logging configuration +
Copy link:https://github.com/businesscode/BCD-UI/blob/master/Server/configFiles/log4j2.xml[BCD-UI/Server/configFiles/log4j2.xml, window="_blank"]
to your project's src/main/resources folder.

. Add entries for the database +
See link:https://github.com/businesscode/BCD-UI/blob/master/Server/configFiles/tomcat/context.xml[context.xml] for entries for several databases for Tomcat. +
The jndi entry
+
[source,xml]
----
 <Environment name="bcdui/defaultConnection" type="java.lang.String" value="jdbc/connectionXX"/>
----
is important as it denotes the connection used of none is explicitly given in a BindingSet.

==== Optionally

Add BCD-UI Java sources::
For debugging of server components it might be helpful to add the java sources of BCD-UI to the eclipse workspace.
The easiest way is to download or git-clone the BCD-UI project from github to an extra folder outside of your workspace.
Then configure the source location via menu:Right-Click-Project(Build Path>Configure Build Path), by selecting bcdui-core.jar
and assign `Server/src/main/java` of the download location as source attachment.

=== BCD-UI folder layout

BCD-UI follows standard Java Web Application layout. +
One thing less common though is that the JavaScript and other static sources come with the 2 BCD-UI jars mentioned. So they are in these jars in WEB-INF/lib and not in your web content folder next to WEB-INF. +
StaticResourceServlet of BCD-UI assures that for the client it looks as if they were there though.
