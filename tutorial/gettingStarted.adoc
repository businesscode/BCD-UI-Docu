[[DocGettingStarted]]
== Getting Started

At its core, a BCD-UI application is a standard Jakarta EE web application.
For the following, we assume you already have a blank application running.

TIP: If you don't know how to make a vanilla application running with your IDE and Tomcat, have a look at the <<DocBootstrap,Bootstrap>> chapter.


Once you have your standard application running, just do these 4 steps detailed in <<DocAppsetup,Application Setup>> to turn it into a BCD-UI applcation

* Add bcd-ui-core.jar and bcd-ui-theme.jar to your dependencies
* Copy some entries into your web.xml
* Define database connection and default in context.xml
* Add log4j2.xml

and you are read to go.

TIP: You may have a look in <<DocBootstrap,Bootstrap>> on how to improve Eclipse and Tomcat support for BCD-UI.
