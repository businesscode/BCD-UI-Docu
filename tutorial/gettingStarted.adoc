== Getting Started

At its core, a BCD-UI application is a standard Jakarta EE web application.
For the following, we assume you already have a blank application running.

If you are not an experienced Java web application developer, make sure you have a plain Java web application running before you turn it into a BCD-UI application. +

TIP: If you don't know how to make a vanilla application running with your IDE and Tomcat, check the <<DocBootstrap,Bootstrap>> chapter.

To turn a plain into a BCD-UI application, just do these 4 steps, detailed out in <<DocAppsetup,Application Setup>>, to turn it into a BCD-UI application

* Add bcd-ui-core.jar and bcd-ui-theme.jar, and their dependencies
* Copy some entries into your web.xml
* Define database connection and default in context.xml
* Add log4j2.xml

and you are read to go.

Let's continue by creating our <<DocSimpleReq,first page>> with BCD-UI.
