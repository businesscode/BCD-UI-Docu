== Your first BCD-UI page

In this section we create a small BCD-UI application and explain some core concepts. +

=== Overview

These are the steps of this section:

. Page Setup: Create an HTML empty page for over-all layout
. Use BCD-UI's _SimpleModel_ to load static data from an XML file
. Add a _Renderer_ to transform data to HTML
. Use an _AutoModel_ to dynamically load data from the database
. Add a _PeriodChooser_ an apply button to reload the page with data of the selected date
. Use a _SingleSelect_ to further filter the data


=== Step by step

==== Set the page up

While you are totally free in your page layout, BCD-UI comes with useful artifacts and page structure which we use here. Add the following as WebContent/simpleReq/index.html to your application and adjust the urls in _<head>_ to `../`

// tag::blankBcduiPage[]
.A blank BCD-UI page
[source,html,linenums,highlight='6,19-20,25-26,31']
----
include::../web/blankPage.html[]
----
<1> Loads BCD-UI library including theme
<2> Root of page structure of BCD-UI theme
<3> Menu will go here
<4> This we call 'SideBar', this is where we will later place report filters
<5> Here we will place the data output and show the guiStatus' content
<6> Here we will display our output
<7> Any of your own JavaScript code goes here or in an extra js file
// end::blankBcduiPage[]

Now we already have an empty but fully styled page, start Tomcat and open it in a browser. If _MyApp_ is you application's name, open _http://localhost:8080/MayApp/simpleReq/index.html_

image::images/simpleReq_blankPage.png[]

TIP: BCD-UI theme has 2 parts: +
The part that is responsible for the overall page layout and structure is shown here. Usage of this part is optional. You can also use your favorite page structure and css instead. +
The part that styles widgets and components is mandatory to style these artifacts.

==== Add static data

Add a file with the following content as `/simpleReq/staticData.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
include::../web/sampleWrs.xml[]
----

Above XML is a sample of a BCD-UI's _WebRowSet_ format Wrs, which is used to transfer data. +
While you can use any data format with BCD-UI including other XML formats or JSON, using WebRowSet format provides many benefits and functionality as this format is known to BCD-UI.

Now add the following script block to end of the page:

.Load static data
[source,javascript]
var staticData = new bcdui.core.SimpleModel("staticData.xml");

A link:../jsdoc/bcdui.core.SimpleModel.html[bcdui.core.SimpleModel^] is used to load data from the server.
Like all models it is loaded lazy, so it is not loaded to the client until a displaying component requests it. +

TIP: There is a full JavaScript link:https://businesscode.github.io/BCD-UI-Docu/jsdoc/[online API documentation^] for all classes of BCD-UI. Keep this open.

==== Add a Renderer

Create a link:../jsdoc/bcdui.core.Renderer.html[bcdui.core.Renderer^] to display the data.
A _Renderer_ expects at least a _DataProvider_ (our SimpleModel is a _DataProvider_) plus an HTML element id (targetHtml) where the show the output.

.A typical renderer created with JavaScript
[source,javascript]
var renderer = new bcdui.core.Renderer({
  inputModel: staticData,
  targetHtml: "myDataDiv"
});

NOTE: By default, the result is rendered as a plain table. You will often want to provide some other layout. To do this, you create a custom XSLT, JavaScript or doT.js file turning Wrs into HTML and provide it to the renderer. We come to this later.

The result is:

image::images/simpleReq_renderer_only.png[]

Congratulations, this is already your first BCD-UI page!

===== Use an HTML custom element instead

You can also use an HTML custom element to create a renderer. The advantage is that it goes right where it will appear. To do this, replace `<div id="myDataDiv"></div>` with

.A typical renderer created with HTML custom elements
[source,html]
<bcd-renderer inputModel="staticData"></bcd-renderer>

How does it reach the `staticData` variable?
While the JavaScript version above references the JavaScript variable `staticData` directly, the HTML custom element only knows the id of the input model. You register your DataProviders simply by giving them an `ìd`:
[source,javascript]
var staticData = new bcdui.core.SimpleModel({id: "staticData", url: "staticData.xml" });

NOTE: The JavaScript variable, and the id are both `staticData` in this example, but they are completely separate things and do not need to be identical.


==== Load data from database

Instead of reading the data from a static file, we will now access the database.

===== Connect to your database

<<DocBinding,BindingSets>> connect BCD-UI to your database. Each database access is mediated by a BindingSet. For the following you obviously need a database and some data. Please identify or create a table with some columns including a date column, give it the id `dy`, and some data. Make sure you have the right database driver in your Java dependencies. For example add it to gradle() and refresh), or download it and put it into WEB-INF/lib.

Add the following as testData.xml to `WEB-INF/bcdui/bindings`, and adjust it to your table.

TIP: All server side config files of BCD-UI go into WEB-INF/bcdui. It's subfolder `bindings` holds the binding files.

[source,xml]
----
<BindingSet xmlns="http://www.businesscode.de/schema/bcdui/bindings-1.0.0"
  id="carRepairs" table="car_repairs"
  dbSourceName="jdbc/myDb"> <!--1--> <!--2--> <!--3-->

  <C id="id" caption="Id" isKey="true"> <!--4-->
    <Column>id</Column> <!--5-->
  </C>
  <C id="dy" caption="Dy">
    <Column>dy</Column>
  </C>
  <C id="yr" caption="Year">
    <Column>EXTRACT( YEAR from dy)</Column> <!--6-->
  </C>
  <C id="country" caption="Country">
    <Column>country</Column>
  </C>
  <C id="station" caption="Station">
    <Column>station</Column>
  </C>
  <C id="carsSold" caption="Cars sold">
    <Column>cars_sold</Column>
  </C>
  <C id="carsRepaired" caption="Cars repaired">
    <Column>cars_repaired</Column>
  </C>
</BindingSet>
----
<1> `id`: The BindingSet's logical name in the application
<2> `table`: The real table/view name in your database
<3> `dbSourceName` which database connection to use
<4> A logical BindingItem name
<5> The real column name in you database
<6> You may any valid column expression here

For dbSourceName use a name of a DataSource you defined in your context.xml during <<DocAppsetup,Application Setup>>.

===== Create an AutoModel

A link:../jsdoc/bcdui.core.AutoModel.html[bcdui.core.AutoModel] allows for simple data loading cases, where filtering, grouping and ordering is sufficient. +
In th following sample the requested data is filtered by country and day. We will add these filters later, for now they are not set and all data is loaded.

Add this to the script block at the end of the page:

.For simple requests, AutoModels may be enough
[source,javascript]
----
var carRepairs = new bcdui.core.AutoModel({
  bRefs: "dy country station carsSold carsRepaired",
  filterBRefs: "country dy",
  bindingSetId: "carRepairs",
  isDistinct: true
});
----

To let the renderer show this data, change the renderer's parameter to `inputModel: carRepairs`.

Reload the page: Now you are already using your database!

==== Add a PeriodChooser
In this section we add a link:../jsdoc/bcdui.widget.PeriodChooser.html[bcdui.widget.PeriodChooser^] to retrieve a subset of our data specified by a date range. We also add an apply button to reload the page with this filter setting.

To place the period chooser, and the apply button on the page, add the two sections like the following to the element with class `bcd\__sidebar-left__inner`, one for the period chooser and one for the apply button.

.Section in the sidebar
[source,html]
----
<section>
  <div class="bcd__form-group">
    <label>Period Chooser</label>
    <div class="bcd__select-container">
      <div id="periodChooserDiv"></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</section>
----

The chooser and the button are then created with JavaScript as follows:

.Sample for creating widgets via JavaScript
[source,javascript]
----
bcdui.widget.createPeriodChooser({
  targetModelXPath: "$guiStatus/*/f:Filter/f:And[@id = 'myPeriodChooser']", // <1>
  targetHtml: 'periodChooserDiv', // <2>
  isWeekSelectable: true // <3>
});
bcdui.widgetNg.createButton({
  onClickAction: bcdui.core.lifecycle.applyAction,
  targetHtml: 'applyDiv',
  caption: 'Apply'
});
----
<1> This tells the PeriodChooser to write its selected result into the model named `guiStatus` at the specified path
<2> This is the HTML element where the widget is displayed
<3> These are further widget specific settings

Voilà! data loaded from database with a filter.

image::images/simpleReq_period_chooser.png[]

NOTE: The PeriodChooser we will be using works on well-known _BindingItem_ names to support some automatic functionality. It is mandatory to name date related BindingSet items on of `dy, cw, cwyr, mo, qr, yr` with an optional postfix.
[source,xml]
<C id="dy"><Column>booking_date</Column></C>

==== The important _guiStatus_
BCD-UI creates a page-wide singleton model named `guiStatus`, accessible via `bcdui.wkModels.guiStatus` (or by name), which serves as the default place to store user interaction data.

To get an impression on how this guiStatus model looks like, add the following debugging utility to the JavaScript section in our page. Also add the target div with id `myGuiStatusDiv` in the main area within bcd__content-container:

[source,javascript]
----
bcdui.widget.visualizeXml.visualizeModel({
  inputModel: bcdui.wkModels.guiStatus,
  targetHtml: "myGuiStatusDiv"
});
----

This utility widget simply displays the content of the guiStatus to div#myGuiStatusDiv. Play with the period chooser and see the filter change. +
This is done with the help of _two-way binding_ of widgets and models. If the widget changes the model changes, but if the model changes it also propagates the changes back to the widget. We see more of this in the coming section.

image::images/simpleReq_guiStatusWidget.png[]

When the apply button is clicked, the _guiStatus_ document is sent to the sever, which uses f:Filter for limiting loaded data.
You should see that the url has a guiStatus parameter with the (compressed) guiStatus.

So when you set up a widget to create a filter, the targetXPath argument describes what filter elements are written to the guiStatus.
For example our example filter f:Filter translates to

[source,sql]
SELECT ... FROM mytable WHERE booking_date BETWEEN '2021-01-01' AND '2021-01-31';

Further details on Wrs requests and f:Filters can be found <<DocXmlData,below>>

In praxis, you will debug the _guiStatus_ by opening the JavaScript console of your browser and enter
----
bcdui.wkModels.guiStatus.getData()
----
you can then see the content of _guiStatus_

image::images/simpleReq_debugGuistatus.png[]

==== Add a SingleSelect

We do now add a more complex filter link:../jsdoc/bcdui.widgetNg.html#.createSingleSelect[bcdui.widgetNg.SingleSelect:^], which is using data for displaying a selection to the user.

Create a model from small static inline data with country data like this:

.StaticModel for inline data
[source,javascript]
----
var countriesModel= new bcdui.core.StaticModel({
  id: "countriesModel",
  data: '<Wrs xmlns="http://www.businesscode.de/schema/bcdui/wrs-1.0.0"><Data>' +
      ' <R><C caption="Germany">DE</C></R>' +
      ' <R><C caption="USA">US</C></R>' +
      ' <R><C caption="Spain">ES</C></R>' +
      '</Data></Wrs>'
});
----

The link:../jsdoc/bcdui.core.StaticModel.html[bcdui.core.StaticModel^] gets a static inline string which is parsed and made available.

IMPORTANT: The `id` attribute makes the model available not only as a JavaScript object but also by name in BCD-UI's registry. With that it can also be used in declarative contexts like the HTML custom elements and XPath expressions and more, where you cannot reference a JavaScript variable directly.

The SingleSelect widget we want to use here must be added to `bcd\__sidebar-left__inner` div, in the same way as the apply button and the period chooser above.

The `SingleSelect` widget is again created with JavaScript. Note that the values which are presented to the user are referenced with the XPath expression. You should make yourself familiar with XPaths as they are used quite often.

[source,javascript]
----
bcdui.widgetNg.createSingleSelect({
  targetHtml: 'countryChooserDiv',
  targetModelXPath: "/*/f:Filter/f:Expression[@bRef = 'country' and @op = '=']/@value",
  optionsModelXPath: "$countriesModel/wrs:Wrs/wrs:Data/wrs:R/wrs:C/@caption",
  optionsModelRelativeValueXPath: ".."
});
----

The optional `optionsModelXPath` argument specifies the data source for the options presented to the user.
Because `optionsModelXPath` is a string attribute we had to set an explicit id for the StaticModel as mentioned.

NOTE: References to a DataProviders in XPaths are built with a `$` followed by the DataProvider's id, like `$countryModel`.

.Sample for HTML custom elements
[source,html]
----
<label>Country</label>
<div class="bcd__select-container">
  <bcd-singleselectng
      targetModelXPath = "/*/f:Filter/f:Expression[@bRef = 'country' and @op = '=']/@value"
      optionsModelXPath = "$countriesModel/wrs:Wrs/wrs:Data/wrs:R/wrs:C/@caption",
      optionsModelRelativeValueXPath = ".."></bcd-singleselectng>
</div>
----

Since the expression does not start with a `$` with a model name, the chosen item will be stored in the _guiStatus_ (it's the default) using the targetXPath position.
In this case we write a filter on the "country" _BindingItem_.
You can find more about widgets <<DocWidgets,here>>.

==== Two-way binding of widgets
If you have both versions of the country chooser (JavaScript and custom HTML) on the page, you will notice that they are always in sync. That is, if you change one, the other changes as well. This shows an important feature of BCD-UI. +

IMPORTANT: When somebody (like our chooser) writes to a model (here _guiStatus_), the model informs all listeners about any change. This gives them the chance to reflect the value correctly at any time. +

Widgets use _guiStatus_ as the default model but this concept is true for all models of BCD-UI and not only for widgets. For example paste the following line into your browser's JavaScript console (adjust the xPath to your setup):

[source,javascript]
----
bcdui.wkModels.guiStatus.write("/*/f:Filter/f:Expression[@bRef='country']/@value", "US", true)
----

It calls the link:https://businesscode.github.io/BCD-UI-Docu/jsdoc/bcdui.core.StaticModel.html#write[write()^] method on `guiStatus` which is itself a `StaticModel` to set a value at the specified xPath and with `true` as the last parameter informs all dependent listeners, widgets etc about changes.


[NOTE.bcd_exercise]
As an exercise, create a new button on the top of the page calling a function setting your chooser to some value with this method.
